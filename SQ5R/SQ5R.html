    <center><strong>SQ5R METHOD</strong></center>
    <p>
      The SQ5R study method is one system for active reading.
      Actively processing information improves comprehension
      and retention of the material.
    </p>

    <p><ol>
      <li><strong>SURVEY</strong></li>
        Before reading a chapter or passage, read the introduction
        and summary. Skim topic headings, bold-faced words,
        pictures, charts, and graphs to get an idea of the
        general structure and content before beginning to read.
    </p>

    <p>
      <li><strong>QUESTION</strong></li>
        Formulate a purpose for the reading by developing
        questions from the topic and headings skimmed in
        the survey step. Ask who, what, where, when, why,
        and how questions: the best questions are general,
        covering main topics and important points.
    </p>

    <p>
      <li><strong>READ</strong></li>
        Break the material into sections which take about
        20 minutes to read and go section by section.
        Look for answers to your questions, key concepts,
        and supporting details. Study charts, graphs, tables,
        and pictures which serve to present new information
        and tie together concepts from the reading.
   </p>

    <p>
      <li><strong>RESPOND</strong></li>
        After each section, think about the material you have just
        read and answer the questions you have asked. This can
        be done during the reading step, since response is
        often automatic. The purpose of this step is to think
        about the material and take notice of what is important.
    </p>

    <p>
      <li><strong>RECORD</strong></li>
        Go back and underline key concepts and take notes.
        This can be done on a separate sheet of paper,
        on note cards, in the margins of the textbook,
        or any way that works well for you.
        <strong>
          (Do this after each section.)
        </strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      <li><strong>RECITE</strong></li>
        Next, look away from the material and try to recite
        the key information and ideas in your own words.
        Reread the material until you are able to recall
        the most important points. This may be frustrating at
        first, but will lead to better understanding and save
        review time in the long run.
    </p>

    <p>
      <li><strong>REVIEW</strong></li>
        After reading the entire chapter, scan and review the
        information aloud or in your head. Discuss the material
        with a classmate if possible. Identify overall themes
        and relationships between concepts. Revise notes or
        markings so they can be easily understood later.
